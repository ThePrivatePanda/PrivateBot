## <h1 align="center">PrivateBot for Discord</h1>

### **From the Developer:**
Hey there! I am koala, or the koala, the current sole developer of this bot.
This bot was made almost entirely for my own education purposes, as well as me wanting to do something "big" rather than singular projects.  
I.e. slap them all in a single bot.

I do not actively maintain it however I do welcome contributions.
Due to the same reason, this bot theoretically does not support multi-server config, but it should work fine I geuss?

You can contact me on discord at `Koala#9712`
